Project 1: Pokemon Evolution
Summary: This program allows users to input commands to increase the Pokémon's level and display the current pokemon. 
Key Feature:
- The user will be able to select from these four options every time they play the game...
- Train: increases pokemon level by 1
- Gym Battle: increases pokemon level by 2 if pokemon wins, by 0 if it loses. (Randomize this event) (If this is too difficult just increase pokemon level by 2)
- This program simulates the Pokémon evolving by changing the name of the pokemon. If the Pokemon is not ready to evolve, it does not do nothing.
